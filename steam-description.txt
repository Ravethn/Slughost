Paranormal slugcat activity detected, who are we going to call?! This mod spawns a controllable ghost slugcat when a player dies. I made this mod so players who die early in co-op can still move around if they want, hope you like it!

Slug ghosts have a teleportation power if they hold the GRAB button for a couple seconds! The ghost can teleport to the player the camera is following. If the camera is on the ghost itself it sends them to a random entrance to the room instead. If you manage to die somehow as a ghost, teleportation will also revive.

Special ghost powers:

-Artificer can still use their explosive jump / parry!

-Saint can pick up things normally since they are so in tune with the world!

-No other special ghost powers right now, but I got some ideas for cool abilities!
